The red cards, especially the diamonds, are more valuable based on the rank bump.\n2. Among the diamonds, D5 has a baseline score, but it doesn't have a rank bump. \n3. The other cards do not have significant rank bumps either, but I will consider their baseline scores.\n\nHere's my assessment of the cards:\n\n- D5: (baseline score +0.4)\n- C7: (baseline score +0.2)\n- H2: (baseline score +0.4)\n- S9: (baseline score +0.2)\n- D11: (baseline score +0.4)\n- C3: (baseline score +0.2)\n- H10: (baseline score +0.4)\n- S12: (baseline score +0.2)\n- D1: (baseline score +0.4)\n- C4: (baseline score +0.2)\n\nGiven that all cards have low baseline scores and no significant rank bumps, I will focus on the diamonds and the higher baseline scores. \n\nI will select D5, D11, and D1 multiple times as they are the best options available.\n\nFinal Card List: [D5, D5, D11, D11, D1, D1, H10, H10, C7, C3]"
