Among the red cards, D5 has a baseline score, while H9 has a higher rank but no special tier.\n4. The black cards (C7, S2, H3, C10, S8, S1) are less relevant based on my scoring system.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will prioritize the cards based on their relevance and scores:\n\n- D5 (baseline red card)\n- H9 (baseline red card)\n- C7 (black card, lower relevance)\n- S2 (black card, lower relevance)\n- H3 (black card, lower relevance)\n- C10 (black card, lower relevance)\n- S8 (black card, lower relevance)\n- D11 (baseline red card)\n- C4 (black card, lower relevance)\n- S1 (black card, lower relevance)\n\nHowever, since I must focus on the most relevant cards, I will repeat the cards that score higher based on my knowledge.\n\nFinal Card List: [D5, D5, H9, H9, D11, D11, C7, S2, H3, C10]"
