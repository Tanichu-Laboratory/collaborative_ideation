Other red cards (hearts and diamonds) have a lower score, while black cards have the lowest.\n\nFrom the Sampler's list:\n- The diamonds (D10, D11, D12, D13) are all valuable, with D13 being the highest rank.\n- Hearts (H1, H2, H7) are less valuable than diamonds but still contribute positively.\n- Clubs (C3, C4) and Spades (S4) are the least prioritized.\n\nConsidering the above, I will focus on the diamonds first, followed by the hearts, and then include the black cards minimally.\n\nFinal Card List: [D13, D12, D11, D10, H1, H2, H7, C3, C4, S4]"
