The other red cards (♦/♥) contribute a score of +0.4, while the black cards (♠/♣) contribute a score of +0.2.\n\nGiven this, I will prioritize the cards based on their scores:\n\n- D11 (♦7) - highest score\n- D6 (♦) - red card\n- H7 (♥) - red card\n- H10 (♥) - red card\n- D1 (♦) - red card\n- C5 (♣) - black card\n- S9 (♠) - black card\n- C3 (♣) - black card\n- H2 (♥) - red card\n- S4 (♠) - black card\n\nNow I will create the final list based on this assessment, ensuring to repeat the cards to reach a total of 10 entries:\n\nCard List: [D11, D11, D6, H7, H10, D1, H2, C5, S9, S4]"
