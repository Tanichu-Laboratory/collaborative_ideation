The only card in Tier C is ♦9, which is not present either.\n\nNext, I will consider the baseline scores for red cards and black cards. The red cards are: ♦1, ♥2, and ♦6. The black cards are: ♠5, ♣9, ♠10, ♣3, ♠11, and ♣7.\n\nThe red cards (♦1, H2, D6) will be prioritized over the black cards due to their higher baseline score.\n\nGiven this, I will select the cards as follows:\n\n- D1 (red card)\n- H2 (red card)\n- D6 (red card)\n- D1 (red card)\n- H2 (red card)\n- D6 (red card)\n- S5 (black card)\n- C9 (black card)\n- S10 (black card)\n- C3 (black card)\n\nThis gives me a final list of:\n\nCard List: [D1, H2, D6, D1, H2, D6, S5, C9, S10, C3]"
