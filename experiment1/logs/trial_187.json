The remaining red cards (♦ and ♥) provide a baseline score of +0.4.\n4. Black cards (♠ and ♣) provide a baseline score of +0.2.\n\nFrom the list, the relevant cards are:\n- Diamonds (D): D11, D12\n- Hearts (H): H10, H11, H12\n- Spades (S): S1, S2, S4, S6, S7\n\nSince there are no cards from Tier A, B, or C, I will focus on maximizing the red cards, as they have a higher baseline score.\n\nHere’s my selection based on the provided cards:\n\nCard List: [D11, D12, H10, H11, H12, H10, H11, H12, S1, S2] \n\nThis list emphasizes the red cards while still including a couple of black cards to fill out the total of 10 selections."

The diamond cards have a slight edge over hearts due to the preference for diamonds in case of ties.\n\nThe best card to select based on the available options is **D10**, as it is a diamond, and I will repeat it to reflect my confidence.\n\nFinal selection list:\nCard List: [D10, D10, D10, D10, D10, D10, D10, D10, D10, D10]"
